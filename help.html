  <h3>How do I use the tool?</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Enter the ID from your softres.it URL.</li>
    <li>Enter the number of points you want to increment by (this actually doesn't matter unless you're uploading a .csv, but the form requires a number either way).</li>
    <li>If you already have a .csv from a previous raid, click the "Browse" button next to "Upload previous CSV", and select the .csv file that you generated last time you used this tool.</li>
    <li>Click "Generate CSV" and wait for it to process.</li>
    <li>Once processing completes, click the download link.</li>
  </ol>
